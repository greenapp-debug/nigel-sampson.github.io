<h1>Windows &amp; Cloud Platform Development</h1>
<h2>by Nigel Sampson</h2>

<p>I'm a software developer in the .NET ecosystem building cloud and mobile solutions since 2002. Increasingly I'm becoming involved with the open source community contributing to a number of projects.</p>
<p>I'm currently based in Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
<p>Regularly I'll post here on some of the interesting things I'm learning during my development and feel could be useful to others.</p>
<p>Right now this work focuses on distributed cloud systems and microservices.</p>
