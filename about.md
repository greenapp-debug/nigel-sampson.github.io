I'm a software developer in the .NET ecosystem building mobile and web solutions since 2002. More and more I'm becoming involved with the open source community contributing to a number of projects.

I'm currently based in Auckland, New Zealand.

## Open Source Projects

 - [Caliburn Micro][cm] - An opinionated MVVM framework for most xaml platforms, I'm primarily responsible for the modern platform ports and am now the project leader.
 - [Spinkit.Xaml][sk] - The conversion of popular CSS spinners to Windows 8 xaml for the Progress Ring control.
 - [Spectrum][spec] - A library to do colour space conversions in .NET and extended into xaml for palette declarations.
 - [Octokit.Caching][caching] - A caching plugin for Octokit using etags and a simple in memory cache.
 - [Xbox Media Remote][xmr] - A Windows 8 app for browsing remote media sources and using Play To to send to the Xbox One, also functions as an example for [Calburn.Micro][cm] functionality.
