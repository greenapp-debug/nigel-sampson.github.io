Last week I had the incredible opportunity to speak at [.NET Conf][conf] on *An Introduction to GraphQL in .NET Core*. It was certainly an novel experience to giving a talk from an empty Pushpay meeting room to an unknown amount of people.

For anyone who would like to see the talk after the fact it's currently on [Twitch][replay] at around the 3:10 mark. I believe the individual talks will be on YouTube later on, I'll update this post when they do.

The [slides][slides] and [demos][demos] are available on GitHub for your perusal as well.
