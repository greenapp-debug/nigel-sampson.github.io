My NDC Sydney 2017 talk "[Techniques in creating great cross platform apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9kxokKuFAQ)" is now available on Youtube.

This talk covers a number of topics:

 - A quick recap of Xamarin and the MVVM pattern.
 - New approaches to share code with Visual Studio 2017.
 - Composition of view models using view locators.
 - Multiple views per view model to create master / details.
 - View model lifecycle and conductors.
 - Messanging and event aggregation.

If you have any feedback and / or questions feel free to get in contact.
