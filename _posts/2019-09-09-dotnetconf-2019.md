I'm pleased to announce that I'll be speaking in a few weeks at the Microsoft virtual conference [.NET Conf][conf]! This looks like it'll be a great conference that covers a wide range of subjects and also includes the launch of .NET Core 3.0.

Personally I'll be speaking on *An Introduction to GraphQL in .NET Core*, I've found a majority of GraphQL 101 style talks are heavily focussed around the Node ecosystem. In fact a lot of discussions around the limitations of a specifics such as schema stitching are more about certainl implementations rather than the appoach in general (but that's another rant). Given this I'm very keen to be able to start with an introduction to using GraphQl with examples of building a service using .NET Core and in particular the [Hot Chocolate][hc] library.
