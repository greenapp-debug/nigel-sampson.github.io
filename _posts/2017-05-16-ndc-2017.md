Really proud to say that I'll be speaking in August at [NDC Sydney][ndc] on [Techniques in creating great cross platform apps.][me]. This talk will be a spiritual successor to [last years talk][previous] where I'll cover some of the newer code sharing options in Visual Studio 2017 and expanding on the ideas of the view model composition that Caliburn.Micro supports.

There's a fantastic [speakers list][speakers] and some really exciting talks I'm looking forward to seeing.

Getting this many great speakers in the same event in this part of the world is a rare feat so I'd recommend taking advantage of it and getting [your ticket][tickets] soon. If you do attend I'd love it you reach out and we can chat about how you build apps in a modern environment.
