Last month I did a talk at the [Auckland Azure Lunchtime meetup][meetup], it covered using Azure Mobile Apps (formerly Mobile Services) to build a cross platform application using Xamarin.

You can view the [slides][azure] and the [demos][github] respectively. Building the demos I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to fit the SDK into my normal MVVM patterns. Often these "backend as a service" SDK's can be very invasive, but with some well defined interfaces all was well.
