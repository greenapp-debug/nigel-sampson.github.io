title: MVP renewed for 2017

Pleased to say that I've had my Microsoft MVP renewed for the fourth year.

Last year was a reasonably quiet year in terms of activity and I'm certainly looking to step it up this year.

Although according to some TED talks announcing goals increase the likelihood of failure, so you'll just have to wait and see.
