tags: windows-apps csharp
---

Last year I had the privledge of being invited onto the project committee for [newly open sourced XAML behaviors][os] project.

Yesterday the `1.1.0` version of the package was released to [nuget][nuget]. This fixed a [nasty bug][bug] in `EventTriggerBehavior` that was causing it to not correctly unsubscribe from the event on detach.

This bug was holding up `3.0.0` final of Caliburn.Micro so I'm now looking at rolling out a release soon.

If you're looking to contribute to UWP XAML Behaviors the project is located on [Github][gh].
