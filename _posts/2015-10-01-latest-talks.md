I've been doing a number of talks lately and most of them are now online.

The first is [Developing Cross Platform Mobile Apps with XAML and MVVM][crossplat] which I delivered at Microsoft Ignite 2015, the recorded video and slides are available on the [Channel 9][crossplat] website.

The second is [Xamarin 101][xam] from the [North Shore .NET User Group][ns], no recording sadly but I've made the slides [publicly available][xam].

Both talks used the same demos on [GitHub][demo].

Hope people find these useful.
