Blown away to say that I'll be speaking this upcoming August at [NDC Sydney][ndc] on [Cross Platform Mobile with XAML and MVVM][me]. There's an awesome [speakers list][speakers] so I'm very excited to attend and see a lot of them speak for the first time. Getting this many great speakers in the same event in this part of the world is a rare feat so I'd recommend taking advantage of it and getting [your ticket][tickets] soon!
