title: Caliburn.Micro roadmap
tags: caliburn-micro
---

In the last couple of days I've put together and published a [roadmap][roadmap] for Caliburn.Micro, there's a couple of reasons for this. The first is help me plan what I want to do and what will be needed, the second to let people know what to expect in the future (although I deliberately didn't attach dates to anything).

It's been a rough six months for me personally in terms of getting time to do open source development, but my life has settled down a lot now and I'm hoping to get back into it.  This roadmap is the first step in that path.

Part of this is also working out how I want to do development on these disparate areas and hopefully encourage other people to help out. I'm considering using GitHub projects to sketch things out in terms of adding notes and potentially pointing the way for others.

Would love to know your thoughts on any of this and the [roadmap][roadmap] itself.
